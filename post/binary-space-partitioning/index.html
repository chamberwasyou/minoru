<p>The supporting plane p of one polygon is chosen as the root of the tree and the other polygons are classified as lying either in front of p behind p or on p. BSP tree partitions space by any hyperplane that intersects the interior of that subspace. Performing these operations requires. Binary Space Partitioning Trees Bruce F. In this work we propose a self-consistent Binary Space Partitioning BSP-Tree process to gener- alize the Mondrian process. Most notably it was used by John Carmack in the creation of the game engine for Doom.</p>

<p>In recent years intensifying research. In 2 dimensional space. The BSP-Tree pro- cess is an almost surely right continuous Markov jump process that allows uniformly distributed oblique cuts in a two-dimensional convex poly- gon. Introduction In most applications involving computation with 3D geometric models manipulating objects and generating images of objects are crucial operations. BSP tree partitions space by any hyperplane that intersects the interior of that subspace.</p>

<p>Binary Space Partitioning is a method of recursively subdividing a space into convex sets using hyper planes. Most notably it was used by John Carmack in the creation of the game engine for Doom. It found an increasing number of applications over the last decades. This process of subdividing gives rise to the representation of objects within the space in the form of tree data structure known as BSP Tree. Binary Space Partitioning BSP Recursively divides the space into two parts until the leaf nodes satisfy the constraints such as minimum number of spatial objects in a partition.</p>

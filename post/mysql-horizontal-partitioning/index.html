		<p><strong>Mysql Horizontal Partitioning</strong>. Horizontal sharding refers to taking a single MySQL database and partitioning the data across several database servers each with identical schema. Get A Free Trial Today. MySQL has mainly two forms of partitioning. Horizontal partitioning reduces the number of rows to be managed while performing any database operation on that table.</p>

<p>HORIZONTAL PARTTITION Horizontal Partitioning divides a large table into smaller manageable parts without having to create separate tables for each part. MySQL 57 does not support vertical partitioning in which different columns of a table are assigned to different physical partitions. Get A Free Trial Today. Use separate tables for each category. An attempt to create a partitioned tables using a storage engine that does not supply native partitioning support fails with ER_CHECK_NOT_IMPLEMENTED. In horizontal partitioning the number of columns is the same in each table but no need to keep the same number of rows.</p>
